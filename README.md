# Jobtracker
JobTracker is a web-based job tracking and recruitment application built using the Django framework. It allows users to register as either an employer or a job seeker. Employers can create a company profile, post job vacancies, and manage all job listings through full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. They can also view and track applications received for each job posting. Job seekers can register, build their profile, upload resumes, and search for job opportunities posted by various employers. They can apply to job vacancies and track the status of their applications. The platform features user authentication, profile management, job filtering by category or location, and role-based dashboards for personalized experiences. Djangoâ€™s powerful ORM is used to handle database operations efficiently, while the frontend uses Bootstrap and JavaScript for a responsive UI. This system simplifies recruitment for companies and streamlines job searching for candidates, making the entire process more organized and transparent. Employers can easily manage job openings, and seekers can access relevant opportunities in one place. JobTrack is ideal for connecting companies and candidates in a professional, scalable, and user-friendly environment.
